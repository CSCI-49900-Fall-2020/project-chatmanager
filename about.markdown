This project was inspired by a [project proposal](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2021/score-2021#chatmanager-an-enterprise-instant-messaging-abstraction-api) submitted for the SCORE 2021 challenge. Many of us routinely interact with instant messaging services for the workplace and for recreation. The goal of the project is to allow interaction between different services, at this moment Slack and Discord, giving users the ability to send messages and files to other users, channels, servers, etc. 

This website will show those interested how to download the project package and create bots that will facilitate this interaction.
